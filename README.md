# TERAMOTO - Motorcycle Service Platform

A comprehensive motorcycle service platform combining workshop booking, parts marketplace, AI gear recommendations, and vehicle sales services.

## Project Status

### ✅ What's Working:
- Solid technical foundation (Next.js 14, Firebase, TypeScript)
- Professional UI/UX with shadcn/ui
- Responsive design
- Authentication system
- Internationalization setup (EN/HR)
- Clean component architecture

### ❌ Critical Gaps:
**Backend Logic Missing:**
- Booking form submits to nowhere
- No database integration
- No real appointment management
- No user data persistence

**Empty Core Features:**
- Marketplace has zero products
- AI assistant is placeholder only
- No actual service scheduling
- No payment processing

**Placeholder Content:**
- All images are placeholders
- Contact info is fake
- No real business data

**Firebase Integration Issues:**
- Environment variables not configured
- Auth works but no user profiles
- No Firestore database setup

## Development Priority:
1. Configure Firebase properly (.env values)
2. Set up Firestore for bookings/users
3. Connect booking form to database
4. Add real product data to marketplace
5. Implement actual AI recommendations
6. Add payment integration

**Current State:** Beautiful demo with zero business functionality (70% UI/UX, 30% working features)

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
